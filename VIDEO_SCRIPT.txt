TRAVEL BOOKING SYSTEM - VIDEO DEMO SCRIPT
==========================================

[INTRODUCTION - 15 seconds]
"Hello! I'm [Your Name], and I'm presenting my Travel Booking System -
a full-stack Django web application that enables users to browse travel
destinations, view vacation packages, and manage bookings. Let's explore
the key features."

[HOME PAGE - 20 seconds]
"Starting at the home page, we can see a statistics dashboard displaying
5 destinations, 5 travel packages, and current bookings. The interface
features a clean navigation menu and showcases featured destinations like
Paris, Bali, and Santorini, along with upcoming travel packages."

[DESTINATIONS - 30 seconds]
"Clicking on Destinations, we can browse all available locations. Each
destination card provides a preview. Let me open Paris for more details...
Here we see a comprehensive description of Paris, and below, all available
travel packages for this destination, such as the 'Romantic Paris Getaway'
starting at $2,199."

[PACKAGES - 40 seconds]
"The Packages page offers powerful search and filtering capabilities.
I can search for specific packages... filter by destination... set a
price range between, say, $1,500 and $2,000... or show only packages
with available spots. Let me click on the 'Bali Beach & Culture' package...
This displays comprehensive details including the price, duration, dates,
available spots, and most importantly, a complete day-by-day itinerary
showing exactly what travelers can expect each day of their trip."

[CREATE BOOKING - 25 seconds]
"Now let's create a booking. Clicking 'Create New Booking'... I'll select
a customer - let's choose John Smith... select the Tokyo Adventure Week
package... enter 2 people... and notice how the system automatically
calculates the total price at $4,998. Submitting the form creates the
booking successfully."

[UPDATE BOOKING - 20 seconds]
"On the Bookings page, I can filter by status - let's show only pending
bookings... Clicking on a booking displays all the details including the
customer information, package details, and current status. I can edit this
booking and change the status from Pending to Confirmed... and save the
changes."

[DELETE - 15 seconds]
"Delete operations are protected with confirmation pages. When attempting
to delete a customer, the system warns about the impact - in this case,
that it will also delete associated bookings - preventing accidental data
loss. I'll cancel this action."

[RELATIONSHIPS - 15 seconds]
"The application demonstrates clear data relationships. Destinations link
to their packages, customers have booking histories, and each booking
connects a customer to a specific package and destination - creating a
complete travel booking ecosystem."

[CONCLUSION - 10 seconds]
"This demonstrates a complete Django application with full CRUD operations,
advanced search and filtering, foreign key relationships between four models,
and a professional, user-friendly interface. Thank you for watching!"
